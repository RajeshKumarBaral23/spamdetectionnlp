📩 SMS Spam Detection using NLP
An NLP-based model to detect spam messages in SMS texts using machine learning techniques.

🚀 Features
Preprocessing of SMS text (tokenization, stemming, stopword removal)
Machine learning models for spam classification (e.g., Naïve Bayes, SVM, LSTM)
Real-time spam detection with accuracy metrics
Interactive UI for testing SMS messages (if applicable)
